\class sf::Keyboard
\ingroup window

sf::Keyboard provides an interface to the state of the
keyboard. It only contains static functions (a single
keyboard is assumed), so it's not meant to be instantiated.

This class allows users to query the keyboard state at any
time and directly, without having to deal with a window and
its events. Compared to the KeyPressed and KeyReleased events,
sf::Keyboard can retrieve the state of a key at any time
(you don't need to store and update a boolean on your side
in order to know if a key is pressed or released), and you
always get the real state of the keyboard, even if keys are
pressed or released when your window is out of focus and no
event is triggered.

Usage example:
\code
if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Left))
{
    // move left...
}
else if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Right))
{
    // move right...
}
else if (sf::Keyboard::isKeyPressed(sf::Keyboard::Escape))
{
    // quit...
}
\endcode

\class sf::Window
\ingroup window

sf::Window is the main class of the Window module. It defines
an OS window that is able to receive an OpenGL rendering.

A sf::Window can create its own new window, or be embedded into
an already existing control using the create(handle) function.
This can be useful for embedding an OpenGL rendering area into
a view which is part of a bigger GUI with existing windows,
controls, etc. It can also serve as embedding an OpenGL rendering
area into a window created by another (probably richer) GUI library
like Qt or wxWidgets.

The sf::Window class provides a simple interface for manipulating
the window: move, resize, show/hide, control mouse cursor, etc.
It also provides event handling through its pollEvent() and waitEvent()
functions.

Note that OpenGL experts can pass their own parameters (antialiasing
level, bits for the depth and stencil buffers, etc.) to the
OpenGL context attached to the window, with the sf::ContextSettings
structure which is passed as an optional argument when creating the
window.

Usage example:
\code
// Declare and create a new window
sf::Window window(sf::VideoMode(800, 600), "SFML window");

// Limit the framerate to 60 frames per second (this step is optional)
window.setFramerateLimit(60);

// The main loop - ends as soon as the window is closed
while (window.isOpen())
{
   // Event processing
   sf::Event event;
   while (window.pollEvent(event))
   {
       // Request for closing the window
       if (event.type == sf::Event::Closed)
           window.close();
   }

   // Activate the window for OpenGL rendering
   window.setActive();

   // OpenGL drawing commands go here...

   // End the current frame and display its contents on screen
   window.display();
}

SFML will try to match the given limit as much as it can,
but since it internally uses sf::sleep, whose precision
