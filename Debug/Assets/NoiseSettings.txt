! Value explainations:

! Frequency: The base frequency of the "noise wave".
! Normally a very low value (0.0000025 by default), but can be "high" (around 1.0...10.0) with "inverted" lacunarity and persistance.

! Lacunarity: The frequency factor per octave. 
! 	Example: With a frequency of 0.05, and a lacunarity of 2.0, you'd get the following result:
!		Octave 1: 0.05
!		Octave 2: 0.1
!		Octave 3: 0.2
!		Octave 4: 0.4
!		etc...

! Persistance: Determines how much each octave affects the value. 
! Normally in range of 0...1, can be more, should not be negative.
!	Example: With a Persistance of 0.4, and 4 Octaves:
! 		Octave 1: 1.000 (61.6%) 
!		Octave 2: 0.400 (24.6%)
!		Octave 3: 0.160 (9.9%)
!		Octave 4: 0.064 (3.9%)

! Octaves: The number of runs the algorithm should do per point.
! More octaves often means higher precision, however, does also affect performance. Normally about 8...16.

! Seed: The base seed used to scramble the hash. Remove or comment out to get seed based on time.
